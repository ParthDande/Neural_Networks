# Neural_Networks
 This is the repo of Neural Network  projects made by me
The first File is Iris Flower Classification using Neural Networks
This is a simple 2 layer neural network to classifiy the flowers based on 4 features sepal_width,sepal_length,petal_width,petal_length.
The output layer would be 3 class  but we have used OnehotEncoder to assign a numerical value to each class
